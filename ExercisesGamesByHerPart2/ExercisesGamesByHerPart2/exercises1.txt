Simon works at a bakery
his boss is named Mark.
Mark is a really grumpy man
with greying brown hair and always furrowed brow.
Simon was scared of dissapointing mark so even when he made misstakes,
like when he added to much pepper to the gingerbread cookies,
he doesn't dare to tell him about it.
So mark get to know about it from the customers instead.
