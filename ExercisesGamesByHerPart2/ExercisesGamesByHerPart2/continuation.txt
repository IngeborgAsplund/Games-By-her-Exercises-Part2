One day Simon messed up exceptionally bad.
When he should make banana milkshake he forgot
to put the lid on the mixer so the entire
bakery where splattered with mushed banana and icecream.
While he was tiding up the mess, the cake he had in the oven burnt
and the fire alarm went off. In the middle of all this chaos
Mark arrived. Simon got terrified by the sight since he
believed that Mark would be enraged and fire him on the 
spot. But instead his boss took pity on him and helped
sorting out the mess. It turns out that everybody starts somewhere
and once upon a time Mark was were Simon is now, it is all a matter
of experience. Everybody can make misstakes, the important thing is not
to never make them but to learn from them so that they do not repeat.
